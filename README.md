# hello-world
Repository for learning

Basically I am woriking as a Logistic Specialist, and I do not like it. I started a JAVA course 6 months ago, and fell in live with programming. Then it was a bit dry, I tried a JavaScript course, and saw the endless possiblities which programming has in itself. I decided I will do everything in my power to learn and live with programming, and I will be a Developer, and start my own firm in the short future.
